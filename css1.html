            <h2>My Raving History</h2>
            <p>I first began raving in 2021, when I was a junior in college. It has now been two years since I started and has 
                now become my biggest hobby and passion. Not only have I grown to love the music, but the raving community as 
                well. The songs within the genre of EDM contain melodies and lyrics that are moving, motivating, and eye-opening. 
                They resonate with so many emotions, including, but not limtited to, love, heartbreak, passion, struggle, sadness, 
                and happiness. The artists have an amazing capability of evoking emotions within their audience with their music. 
                I have discovered a group of people who are unwaveringly accepting of everyone who they come across. I have met so 
                many kind-hearted indivudals who are still a part of my life to this day. There are numerous stereotypes surrounding 
                this activity that I have learned to overlook thanks to all of my experience throughout the years. The music, the 
                people, and the rave setting as a whole, have touched my heart and soul, and continue to do so. The Seattle raving
                community is known for being one of the best in the country and I am grateful that I have began and continue within it.
