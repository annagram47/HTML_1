  <h1>Hello ENGL 388</h1> 
  <p>My name is Anna Morris and I am a graduating senior at the University of Washington. 
    I am studying political science but planning to pursue advertising after I graduate. 
    I decided to take ENGL 388 in order to strengthen my writing skills. I grew up in 
    Renton but was originally born in Russia. I came to the United States at four and a 
    half when I was adopted. I have two younger biological siblings who I was lucky 
    enough to grow up with. My hobbies consist of 17 years of dance, reading as of 
    recently, and spending quality time with my siblings. I am excited to see what I will 
    learn from this course this quarter!
