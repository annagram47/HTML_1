    <h1> My Favorite Foods</h1>
            <h2> List of My <em> Favorite</em> Foods:</h2>
            <p> I love eating out with my friends! Trying different kinds of food is always a fun adventure, but below are the cuisines that I never get tired of and would highly recommend trying at least once. They primarily originate from Asian countries because I enjoy the flavors that are emphasized throughout the dishes. I also love how each type of food is unique to the country they come from because it gives me (quite literally) a taste of the cultures around the world. They can all mostly be categorized as savory dishes since I don’t have a very big sweet tooth. But when it comes to sweeter foods, I always lean toward fruits because I love how their sweetness is natural and not artificial, allowing for a more subtle flavor that doesn’t overwhelm me. They’re also healthy for me so I get to enjoy something sweet that is good for me! </p>

    <h1> My Favorite Bands</h1>
    <p> I listen to a <strong> very </strong> wide range of music. The bands and artists I listen to come from different time periods, so they range from anywhere between the 1970's to today. The genres they would be categorized under include KPOP, EDM, various styles of rock and indie, alternative, R&B, and more. I like a lot of older artists because I grew up listening to them thanks to my parents. And all of the newer artists I discovered myself!</p>
